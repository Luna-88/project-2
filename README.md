# EvolveU - Project 2

<img src="https://github.com/Luna-88/project-2/blob/gameComponent/client/src/assets/images/backgrounds/github_bg.png" width="600">

An in-class proof-of-concept, skills-building exercise to construct the framework for a text-based game using `node`, `Express JS`, and additional exploratory learning in `mongoDB Atlas`, the `pug` front-end renderer and other technologies.

### Requirements

This project was built in Javascript with `node v15.11.0`, and tested in the latest public versions of Safari and Chrome.

### Installation

This version requires little additional config to run:

-   In a new folder, from your Terminal.app, `git clone https://github.com/luna-88/project-2`
-   Change to the current release branch: `git checkout gameComponent`
-   In both the `/server` and `/client` folder, `npm install` - to download dependencies and configure
-   Finally, in both the `/server` and `/client` folders, run `npm run` - to start the servers

Your server will now be running at [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030). From the browser, begin.
